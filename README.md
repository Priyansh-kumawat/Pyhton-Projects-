#This is a Machine Learning based project .

Here I have used algorithms like Linear Regression , Randomforestregressor and SVMregressor to predict the price for two people going to restaurant in city like Gurgaon , Delhi and Noida on the behalf of India.

I implemented techniques like Feature Engineering , One hot encoding etc to make it work .

The R2 score also came to be pretty impressive.

Have a look at it .
