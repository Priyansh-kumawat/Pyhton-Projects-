This is a Machine Learning based project .
Here I have used algorithms like Linear Regression , Randomforestregressor and SVMregressor to predict the price for two people going in restaurant in city like Gurgaon , Delhi and Noida .
I implied techniques like Feature Engineering , One hot encoding etc to make it work .
The R2 score also came to be pretty impressive.
Have a look at it .
